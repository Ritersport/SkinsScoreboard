    <string name="greeting">Greetings!

This app will help you determine the winner of a two-player round of Golf. The Skins rules are used.

Enter the number of strokes on each hole for each player sequentially. Be careful! You cannot edit them after entering.

We believe that it is impossible to put more than 1,000 strokes on one hole, so we will not let you enter such a large number.

We wish you a pleasant game!</string>
